We have userd 2 dataset from this link,
1.COVID19
2.NORMAL

We have applied CNN(convolution Neural Network) to predic Covid-19 patient from X-ray image.

first you have to open jupyter notebook and open anaconda. and then run the code. It may take some time to trai  the total image. at the end you will find the accuracy . 


here, cnn is applied. some library ...............
